## The Problem
  In my third year of college, during a software lab class, my classmates and I encountered a common challenge as international students studying abroad: language barriers. Learning complex materials became
  increasingly difficult when we struggled with understanding the language. To compound the issue, most of the tutors and teaching assistants on campus primarily spoke Chinese and had limited proficiency in English. It was clear that we needed a solution. That's when we decided to build an app called 'Teach Me.'
## What is Teach Me?

    Teach Me is a platform designed to connect students with tutors who
    can help them with their studies. To create a seamless user
    experience, we integrated Clerk for the sign-in and sign-up features
    on our website. Clerk proved to be an excellent choice because of its
    simplicity and ease of customization. It allowed us to quickly
    implement secure user authentication without reinventing the wheel.

    In addition to the convenient authentication system, we also wanted to
    ensure a visually appealing and responsive design for our app. To
    achieve this, I decided to explore Tailwind CSS. Tailwind CSS provided
    a robust set of utility classes and an intuitive way to style our app.
    It allowed us to create a beautiful user interface while maintaining
    flexibility and scalability. Through Teach Me, students can easily
    find tutors who are proficient in English and other languages, helping
    them overcome language barriers and excel in their studies. The
    combination of Clerk for authentication and Tailwind CSS for styling
    has made Teach Me a user-friendly and visually appealing platform that
    facilitates effective learning for students.
