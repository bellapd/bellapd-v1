## Tech Stack Used

- Ruby Roda
- Heroku
- PostgreSQL
- Github OAuth

## The Problem 
When brainstorming ideas, we got connected with one same hobby which is traveling. Although we all enjoy
traveling, it is tough for us to meet because we reside in separate regions. As a result, our project intends to
develop a web app that will help users plan their journeys by sharing itineraries and estimating the distance
between each member's location and the destination.

## What is NaviTogether?
NaviTogether is a web application that helps people find a travel buddy to go on a trip together. Users can
create a room, invite friends, and share their location with each other. This app is designed to make it easier
for people to plan trips and share their experiences with others. By using NaviTogether, users can connect
with like-minded individuals and explore new places together. The app also allows users to create a list of
destinations and share it with their friends, making it easier to plan trips and stay organized. 

## System Architecture

## Features 
Several features of NaviTogether is:
1. Account login and sign in using email and even Github SSO.
2. Adding a point of interest ( destinations ) and share it our friends.
3. Sharing location to people that we gave access to.
4. Create a room to manage people and plan the trip.

## Security Concerns
Given our web app's focus on sharing trip itineraries and location data, security was our number one
consideration while creating it. One of our primary worries was data privacy and unwanted access. Users
disclose sensitive trip plans, and illegal access may result in privacy violations. There's also the possibility
that the app's APIs will be exploited, allowing hackers to access the backend and cause data leaks or worse.
Furthermore, we were acutely aware of the possibility of data breaches. Given the nature of our software,
which involves revealing personal whereabouts, a hack might put users at risk of stalking or other harmful
activity. As a result, protecting personal information and avoiding these risks is vital.
