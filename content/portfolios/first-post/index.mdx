# Introduction

Next.js is the most widely used framework for React,and the fact that Next.js takes much less time to build (only took 1~3 minutes) thus,I decided to make my own personal website with it.
There are also several tools that I used to make my website,such as Chakra UI and Vercel.

## 1. Chakra UI

Chakra is a framework that is a component-based library means It consists of fundamental building pieces that could assist you in creating the web application's front end.
Moreover, it supports `React` as well as a few other frameworks and is adaptable, reusable, and scalable code. As a rookie in website development, Chakra UI aid my development process faster.
The only thing I have to do is install and enclose every Next.js component in the `ChakraProvider` component.

## 2. Vercel

Vercel is a platform for frontend frameworks to build your static sites. It is also one of the most popular and free hosting platform for Next.js. Moreover, Vercel is simple to set up and seamlessly interacts with Github.
